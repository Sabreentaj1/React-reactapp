The app follows React best practices, utilizing hooks like useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects. It incorporates proper error handling for the API request and provides a clean and intuitive user interface.
Feel free to explore the code, run the app, and customize it further to meet your specific requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.

## API Reference
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

## Features
The main features of the app include:
1. Data Fetching: The app makes an HTTP request to the API endpoint to retrieve the dataset of employees. It specifically fetches the data from the second page.
2. List View: The fetched dataset is used to populate a list view, where each employee is displayed as a separate list item. Each list item includes the employee's ID, avatar, and first_name.
3. Search Functionality: The app includes a textbox above the list view that allows users to search for employees based on their first_name. As the user types in the search textbox, the list view updates dynamically to display only the employees whose first_name matches the search term.
